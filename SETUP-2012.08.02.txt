------------------------------------------
Things Michael needs to do to get this going.

- use Dave's fork at: https://github.com/ddellacosta/hyperarchy

    $ git clone https://github.com/ddellacosta/hyperarchy

- get Facebook and Twitter applications set up, written into config/application.rb (will work without this for now, but won't let you log in with Facebook/Twitter oauth)

- get Postgres installed.  http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/

- set up a postgres user (role) called 'hyperarchy'.  For development, you'll need to create a datab ase called hyperarchy_development as well.  Reference the file config/database.yml for a list of the databases used by the system.

- install redis

- run the migration:

    $ bundle exec rake db:migrate  # This won't tell you a lot, don't worry.

- now you should be able to run it:

    $ bundle exec rails s

------------------------------------------
Some useful commands:

# this shows you all the Rake tasks available.  This includes stuff like running tests, migrating the db, as well as seeing the routes...

    $ bundle exec rake -T

# very handy task to show you all the routes available in your application, which are configured in the file config/routes.rb

    $ bundle exec rake routes
